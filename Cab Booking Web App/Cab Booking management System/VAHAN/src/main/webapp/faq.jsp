        <h2>1. How to book a cab on a website?</h2>

        <p>For booking a cab, he/she has to enter pickup and drop-off points.  When it comes to projects such as VAHAN, it is mandatory thing that a website should include a driver panel. As it helps the user to track booking and manage it all.</p><br/><br/>

        <h2>2. A route-based booking system that facilitates the issue of journey-cumbooking cab,</h2>
         <p>which can be issued from any station to any station. 
         Passenger journey to multiple laps of booking can be handled from a single terminal window.<br> 
         The booking facility is offered round-the-clock (24 hours uninterrupted).</p><br/><br/>

        <p>Are you tired of waiting in long lines or struggling to find a taxi on the go? A VAHAN is the solution to your transportation woes. By building a VAHAN in Java, you can streamline the process of booking a cab and simplify the entire transportation experience.<br><br/>

        To create a graphic user interface with the jsp(0java server pages). that makes it easier for the user to interact with the cab booking system.<br><br/>

        To use SQL database and provide a way to save information about available taxis, book a taxi for the selected taxi, and get the driver and vehicle number details.<br/><br/>

        I have successfully built a  VAHAN (Cab booking management system) in Java that helps you book a cab . This java project utilizes Jsp(java server pages) for the GUI and is a very efficient and easy way to book a taxi, with all driver and taxi details attached to the JtextArea.
