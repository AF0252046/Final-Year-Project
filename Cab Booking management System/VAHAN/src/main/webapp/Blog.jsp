    <p style="width: 800px;  padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px;"> As VAHAN and our various businesses grow, I sometimes get asked how they connect with each other. So I want to share our vision of the future of mobility, which we call New Mobility, and how we’re building it.<br><br/>
        Through the ages, human progress has been closely tied to advancements in mobility. The wheel, the steam engine, internal combustion and jet engines, cars, planes are all mobility inventions that transformed our lives and made movement safer, faster, efficient, convenient and accessible to more and more people.<br/><br/>
        The IC engine, automobiles and the related ecosystem is a remnant of the past and assumes unsustainably high ownership of vehicles manufactured by OEMs and sold through dealers. Consumers have been downgraded to being just a cog in this giant wheel. This is best indicated by Henry Ford’s – ‘You can have whatever colour you want, as long as it’s black’. Try saying that to an ecommerce customer today!<br/><br/>
        VAHAN is building this New Mobility ecosystem with the consumer at the core. The 3 pillars of this new ecosystem are: New Mobility Services, New Energy Vehicles and New Auto Retail. These three pillars amplify and enhance the impact of each other as part of an integrated VAHAN New Mobility Platform.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;">New Mobility Service</h2><br/><br/>
    <p style="width: 800px;  padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px;"> Today VAHAN provides multi-modal mobility access to  people through Taxis, auto rickshaws, outstation rides etc. But this is just 7% of India’s population.<br/><br/>
        As you use our service more frequently, we will create your unique mobility persona in our cloud and will personalise your experience across shared and personal vehicles. This will also enable new usage models like vehicle subscriptions. <br/><br/>
        We already see strong adoption of our multi-modal platform across VAHAN’s Mumbai city. As we expand to 21 towns and bring shared mobility to 500mn people, the multi-modal offerings will grow substantially and will be central to driving affordability and access for these  peoples <br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;">New Energy Vehicles</h2><br/><br/>
    <p style="width: 800px;  padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px;">
        40% of air pollution in India is due to vehicles. This is when just 15% of India owns a vehicle today! This number will grow exponentially as we provide more affordable options for shared and personal mobility. So we will do this through EVs to ensure us and our planet can breathe free!  <br/><br/>
        We have already moved forward here with our Futurefactory, the largest 2W factory in the world building the first in our range of scooters – the Ola S1, the best scooter ever made. In the coming quarters we will expand our EV range with more scooters, bikes and cars.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;">New Auto Retail</h2><br/><br/>
    <p style="width: 800px;  padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px;">
        Not just the vehicles but the 100+ year old model of dealership based sales and service, standard financing and insurance and unorganised used vehicle sale/purchase is also out of date and needs to change.<br/><br/>
        VAHAN has a unique and significant advantage here being the only mobility company in the world that does the hardware (EVs), software and service (shared mobility services and auto retail) entirely inhouse plus has the deepest understanding of urban mobility needs of consumers. We will lead the development of new technologies and build this future of new mobility to bring a billion people more choice, convenience and affordable mission. This is our mission – mobility for a billion, sustainability for the future! <br/><br/>
        Let’s move! <br/><br/>
